## Job Description

### Defence Research & Development Canada - Atlantic (DRDC)
DRDC is looking for an undergraduate student to assist in researching **negative information** and how it can be exploited in a **defence context**.

The **Royal Canadian Navy (RCN)** requires situational awareness of the maritime domain. The RCN collects **positive information** using sensors to track vessel locations. However, when a sensor is functioning but no positive information is detected, this is referred to as **negative information**. DRDC is researching ways to use negative information to enhance situational awareness, which requires understanding how sensors collect positive information, also known as the **sensor model**.

### Work Term Responsibilities
In this project, the student will:
- Develop **algorithms and models** for exploiting negative information and its dependence on sensor models.
- Learn and use **programming languages** related to data science, including **SQL, R, and Python**.
- Work with **statistical and mathematical modeling** techniques.
- Apply **data analysis methods** to improve maritime situational awareness.

The student will work in a **small team environment**, receiving ample direction while maintaining enough independence to develop **problem-solving and time-management skills** for future work environments.
