# CSCI 2110 - Data Structures and Algorithms

## Course Description
This course provides a **comprehensive introduction** to **data structures and algorithms**, covering their **design, analysis, and implementation**. Emphasis is placed on **abstraction** in algorithm design and **general implementation approaches** that apply across procedural programming languages.

## Topics Covered:
- **Algorithm Analysis**  
  - Asymptotic analysis  
  - Big-O, Big-Theta, and Big-Omega notation  

- **Fundamental Data Structures**  
  - Stacks, queues, lists, vectors  
  - Trees and priority queues  
  - Dictionaries and hashing  

- **Sorting Algorithms**  
  - MergeSort, QuickSort, RadixSort  

- **Advanced Data Structures**  
  - Search trees (BSTs, balanced trees)  
  - Sets and graphs  

- **Graph Algorithms**  
  - Graph traversals (BFS, DFS)  
  - Spanning trees and shortest paths  

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand the **design principles** behind common data structures.
- Analyze algorithms using **asymptotic complexity analysis**.
- Implement **efficient** data structures in a procedural programming language.
- Apply sorting and searching algorithms to **real-world problems**.
- Utilize **graph algorithms** for solving connectivity and pathfinding problems.
