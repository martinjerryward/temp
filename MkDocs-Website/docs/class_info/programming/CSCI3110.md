# CSCI 3110 - Algorithms I

## Course Description
This course covers techniques for the **design and analysis** of **efficient algorithms** and **data structures**. Topics include **asymptotic analysis**, **divide and conquer**, **greedy algorithms**, **dynamic programming**, **optimization algorithms**, and **amortized analysis**. These techniques are applied to **sorting, searching, graph algorithms, and set manipulation**.

## Topics Covered:
- **Algorithm Analysis**
  - Asymptotic analysis (Big-O, Big-Theta, Big-Omega)
  - Amortized analysis  

- **Algorithm Design Techniques**
  - Divide and conquer  
  - Greedy algorithms  
  - Dynamic programming  

- **Data Structure Design**
  - Optimized data structures for efficiency  

- **Optimization Algorithms**
  - Problem-solving techniques for efficiency  

- **Application Areas**
  - Sorting and searching algorithms  
  - Graph algorithms (traversals, shortest paths, spanning trees)  
  - Set manipulation  

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Analyze algorithmic **complexity** using asymptotic notation.
- Design **efficient algorithms** using divide and conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming techniques.
- Implement and optimize **data structures** for specific problems.
- Apply algorithmic strategies to **sorting, searching, and graph-related problems**.

## Prerequisites
- **CSCI 2110.03** and **CSCI 2115.03** (Grade C or better)
