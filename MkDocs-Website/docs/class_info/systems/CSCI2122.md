## Course Description
This course introduces **tools, techniques, and concepts** for **systems programming**, focusing on **low-level programming** and **performance optimization**. Students will gain experience with **assembly language**, the **C programming language**, and concepts such as **memory hierarchies, exception control flow, and performance measurement**.

## Topics Covered:
- **Introduction to Systems Programming**
  - Differences between high-level and low-level programming  
  - Overview of systems programming tools  

- **Assembly Language & Machine Code**
  - Basics of assembly programming  
  - Instruction sets and CPU architecture  

- **C Programming Language**
  - Pointers and memory management  
  - File I/O and system calls  

- **Memory Hierarchies & Performance**
  - Caching and memory optimization  
  - Measuring and improving performance  

- **Exception Control Flow**
  - Signals and interrupts  
  - Process execution and control  

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Write and analyze **low-level programs** in **C** and **assembly**.
- Understand **memory hierarchies** and their impact on performance.
- Implement **system calls** and manage **process execution**.
- Measure and optimize **program performance**.
