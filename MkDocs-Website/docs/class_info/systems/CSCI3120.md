# CSCI 3120 - Operating Systems

## Course Description
This course provides an in-depth study of **operating systems** concepts, including **I/O and interrupt structures, dynamic procedure activation, system structure and evaluation, memory management, process management, and scheduling**. Additional topics include **recovery procedures, concurrency, deadlocks, resource allocation, protection, and operating system implementation**.

## Topics Covered:
- **I/O and Interrupt Structures**
  - Device management and interrupt handling  

- **Memory Management**
  - Paging, segmentation, virtual memory  

- **Process Management & Scheduling**
  - Process creation and termination  
  - CPU scheduling algorithms  

- **Concurrency & Deadlocks**
  - Synchronization techniques  
  - Deadlock prevention and avoidance  

- **Resource Allocation & Protection**
  - Access control mechanisms  
  - Security policies in operating systems  

- **Operating System Implementation**
  - Design and structure of modern operating systems  

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Explain the **core functionalities** of modern operating systems.
- Implement **process scheduling and memory management** techniques.
- Analyze and solve **concurrency and deadlock** issues.
- Understand **resource allocation** and system protection mechanisms.
- Evaluate and compare **operating system architectures**.

## Prerequisites
- **CSCI 2110.03**, **(CSCI 2121.03 or CSCI 2122.03)**, and **(CSCI 2132.03 or CSCI 2134.03)** (Grade C or better)
