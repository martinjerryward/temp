# 🎨✨ Real-Time Web-Based 3D Visualization 🚀🌐

## 🔥 Project Overview
This project aims to build an **interactive, real-time 3D model viewer** for the web using **Three.js, WebGL, JavaScript, and Python**. The goal is to provide users with an intuitive experience to **visualize and manipulate** 3D models directly in their browser. 🖥️🎭

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 🎨 **Frontend:** Three.js, WebGL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- 🖥️ **Backend:** Python (Flask/FastAPI), Node.js (for real-time updates)
- 📂 **Supported Formats:** STL, OBJ, GLTF
- ☁️ **Deployment:** Docker, AWS/GCP (Optional)

---

## 📌 Key Learning Outcomes 📚
- 🖥️ **3D Model Rendering** – Optimizing 3D models for web applications.
- 🎮 **User Interactivity** – Implementing real-time object manipulation.
- ⚡ **Performance Optimization** – Techniques for smooth rendering.
- 🏗️ **Handling Large 3D Assets** – Efficient asset loading and compression.

---

## 🛠️ Core Features
### 🎨 Load & Render 3D Models
- Users can **upload or select** STL, OBJ, or GLTF files.
- Render models in Three.js with **lighting, shading, and materials**.

### 🖱️ User Interactions
- **Rotate, Zoom, Pan** using OrbitControls.
- **Move, Scale, Rotate** models in real-time.

### 🎛️ UI & Enhancements
- **Material Selector** – Customize colors, textures, and lighting.
- **Animation Support** – Play animations in models.
- **Raycasting** – Select and manipulate objects via clicking.

### ⚡ Performance Optimization
- **Level-of-Detail (LOD)** – Reduce rendering load dynamically.
- **Optimized WebGL Calls** – Improve rendering efficiency.

### 🔄 Backend Processing (Optional)
- Convert uploaded files to **optimized GLTF format**.
- Support **server-side rendering** for lower-powered devices.
- API for **user preferences and saved scenes**.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Plan
1. Develop **frontend** with Three.js for rendering.
2. Set up a **lightweight backend** for file handling.
3. Implement an **intuitive UI** with HTML/CSS.
4. Optimize performance with **shaders & LOD**.
5. Deploy using **Docker & AWS/GCP**.
