# 📊 Network Traffic Visualization Guide

This document serves as a reference for visualizing network traffic using Python and Matplotlib. Each section contains a **placeholder Python code block** where you can insert your own implementation.

---

## **1️⃣ Packet Size Over Time (Line Plot)**
📌 **Shows network activity trends over time. Useful for spotting anomalies (e.g., sudden spikes in traffic).**

```python
# Insert code for Packet Size Over Time here
```

---

## **2️⃣ Top 10 Most Active Source IPs (Bar Chart)**
📌 **Identifies the most active devices on your network.**

```python
# Insert code for Top 10 Most Active Source IPs here
```

---

## **3️⃣ Protocol Distribution (Pie Chart)**
📌 **Shows the proportion of TCP vs. UDP vs. ICMP traffic.**

```python
# Insert code for Protocol Distribution here
```

---

## **4️⃣ Packet Size Distribution (Histogram)**
📌 **Helps detect if most packets are small (e.g., ACKs) or large (e.g., file transfers).**

```python
# Insert code for Packet Size Distribution here
```

---

## **5️⃣ Heatmap of Source vs. Destination IPs**
📌 **Useful for detecting high-traffic communication pairs (e.g., a local device constantly sending packets to an external server).**

```python
# Insert code for Heatmap of Source vs Destination here
```

---

## **📌 Additional Notes**
- Ensure you have **Matplotlib, Pandas, and optionally Seaborn** installed for the visualizations.
- Adjust parameters like **packet count, bin sizes, and color schemes** to fine-tune the visuals.
- If dealing with large datasets, consider **sampling or aggregating data** before plotting.

🚀 Happy analyzing!
